        Sri Chaitanya devised a strong Curriculum, integrating the components of
        Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Biology which are needed for the various
        Entrance Exams under the name of TECHNO CURRICULUM.<br /><br />
        The Content Matter is divided into optimum doses so that the students do
        not feel overburdened with the syllabus. At the same time care is taken
        to see that the Components of the Techno Curriculum are strictly
        according to their Normal Course of Study related to the Class in which
        they are studying at present.<br /><br />
        This makes them study their present syllabus in depth with the help of
        the Micro Level Teaching, providing them the chance of improving their
        performance in the current Class in which they are studying.<br /><br /><br />
        <b>C-BATCH:</b><br /><br />
        Our C-Olympiad batch is a platform where the students with a strong
        academics potential and inclination are trained on customized
        preparatory material to take on the tough National and International
        Olympiads and step into the portals of prestigious National level
        professional institutions-IIT’s, NIT’s etc.<br /><br />
        The Main Objective of C-Batch Programming is to see that the IIT’s all
        over the country are filled with the majority of Sri Chaitanya School
        Students. To see Sri Chaitanya Students in the Majority in the TOP – 100
        is the Primary Objective<br /><br /><br />
        <b>MEDICON:</b><br /><br />

        Prestigious Medical Institutions is the Primary Objective of the Medicon
        Programme.<br /><br />
        Medicon - Batch is a specially designed programme, preparing the
        students to appear for the state and National Medical Entrance
        Examinations. It also enables them to secure seats in AIMS, JIPMER, NEET
        etc. and top ranks both in the National and State level.<br /><br /><br />
        <b>IPL-BATCH:</b><br /><br />
        The IPL Batch is created with the sole aim of seeing that the majority
        of TOP 10 & TOP – 50 Students for IIT Selections are filled with the
        students from Sri Chaitanya Schools.<br /><br />
